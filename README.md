# Scrilla (Sub*scri*ptions + B*illa*bles)

Scrilla is a budget visualisation tool built in React.js. It allows a user to very quickly see how much of their Monthly/Fortnightly/Weekly budget is being taken up by the individual items being regularly billed to them.

## Built With
- React
- Chart.js

## Future Features
- A Backend, which would allow users to create accounts, and save their budgets for later viewing/updating.
- A greater range of visualisation tools - so far it's just a pie and a bar chart.
